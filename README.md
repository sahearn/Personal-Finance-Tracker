# Personal-Finance-Tracker
Custom financial tracking and budgeting dashboard

## Background
I spent years of frustration using free and commercial personal finance apps: MS Money, Mint, Quicken, Monarch.  All of them had a lot of great features, but none of them were perfect and most of them couldn't  reliably pull data from my financial institutions. So I decided to write my own.

:warning: Please note this repo does not yet contain the full suite of code, db schemas, etc

## What You'll Need
- PHP
- a database (I use MySQL)
- some third party libraries for styling, graphs, and charts
  - JQuery
  - JQuery Datatables
  - CanvasJS
  - HandsonTable
- a lot of time and patience to customize to your needs
