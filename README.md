# Personal Finance Tracker
Custom financial tracking and budgeting dashboard

## Background
I spent years of frustration using free and commercial personal finance apps: MS Money, Mint, Quicken, Monarch.  All of them had a lot of great features, but none of them were perfect and most of them couldn't  reliably pull data from my financial institutions. So I decided to write my own.

:warning: Please note this repo does not yet contain the full suite of code, db schemas, etc. Maybe someday, but I never really intended this to be public; so the code is an embarrasing mess. At the very least, I want to get enough published to be an inspiration to other DIYers.

## What You'll Need
- PHP
- a database (I use MySQL)
- some third party libraries for styling, graphs, and charts
  - [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
  - [DataTables](https://datatables.net/)
  - [canvasJS](https://canvasjs.com/)
  - [Handsontable](https://handsontable.com/)
- a lot of time and patience to customize to your needs

## My Approach
... in progress ...

- db tables
  - main, categories
- import
- snapshot, totals
- display, layout, printing
- security

## Personal Limitations
- import workarounds due to hosting provider

## To Dos to Consider
- purge scheme (data over x years old)
- more/better automation
- improve txn categorization during import
