# Personal-Finance-Tracker
Custom financial tracking and budgeting dashboard

## Background
I spent years of frustration using free and commercial personal finance apps: MS Money, Mint, Quicken, Monarch.  All of them had a lot of great features, but none of them were perfect and most of them couldn't  reliably pull data from my financial institutions. So I decided to write my own. <span style="color:red;">Please note</span> this repo does not yet contain the full suite of code, db schemas, etc

## What You'll Need
- PHP
- a database (I use MySQL)
- a lot of time to customize to your needs

## My Approach
